Below we have three React components:
- Square
- Board
- Game

Which are custom/user-defined classes:

All these three classes are inheriting the "React.Component" subclasses

We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen. 
When our data changes, React will efficiently update and re-render our components

The Square component renders a single <button> 
The Board renders 9 squares. 
The Game component renders a board with placeholder values which we'll modify later. 
There are currently no interactive components.

        There are generally two approaches to changing data.

        The second approach is to replace the data with a new copy which has the desired changes.

        Examples:
        - Data Change with Mutation
        var player = {score: 1, name: 'Jeff'};
        player.score = 2;
        // Now player is {score: 2, name: 'Jeff'

       - Data Change without Mutation  
       var player = {score: 1, name: 'Jeff'};

        var newPlayer = Object.assign({}, player, {score: 2});
        // Now player is unchanged, but newPlayer is {score: 2, name: 'Jeff'}

        // Or if you are using object spread syntax, you can write:
        // var newPlayer = {...player, score: 2};
